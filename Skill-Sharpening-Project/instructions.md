# Skill Sharpening Project

When learning a new skill, it is crucial to practice it over and over again. This project is designed to help you sharpen your fundamental coding skills. Each file in this project requires you to complete four functions. The files will range in difficulty, but all will require you to reproduce skills you've just learned.

This is the first project of the course. Please read carefully through the instructions and rubric below.

## Project scoring

This project is only based on **completion.** To complete a file, all of the tests associated with that file must pass. Each file you complete is worth 1 point. If you complete no test for that file, you will receive 0 points. If some tests pass for that file, you will receive 0.5 points.

## Run the tests

If you press the "Run" button on Replit, all of the tests will run for this project. However, there are _many_ tests in this project, so you may find it difficult to understand the test output if you run all of the tests.

Instead of pressing the green "Run" button, change to the tab that says "Shell". You will see a command line interface. If you wish to run the tests for a single file, you will need to use this interface while following the instructions below.

### Run a single test file

While in the "Shell" interface, type the following and then press the "Enter" key.

```
npm test 01
```

You should see the tests run, as you are used to seeing. However, if you scroll up to the top of the output, you should see that _only_ the `__tests__/01-functions.test.js` file ran.

You can replace `01` with the number of your test file. For example, if you want to run the tests for `09-array-manipulation.js` file, you can run the following command:

```
npm test 09
```
